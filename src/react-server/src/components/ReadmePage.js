          <h2>Inbox</h2>
          <ul>

            <li>Users can send new emails through the Compose page.</li>

            <li>Drafts do not require a recipient, allowing you to save partial emails at any point.</li>
            <li>Saved drafts are reusableâ€”you can open, edit, and send them later.</li>
            <li>When you're done with a draft, you can move it to the trash.</li>

            <li>Emails in the trash can still be opened and recovered.</li>
            <li>To permanently remove an email, it must be deleted from the trash explicitly.</li>

            <li>Labels can be applied to emails to help with categorization.</li>
            <li>The inbox can be filtered to view only emails with a specific label.</li>
            <li>Users can rename or delete existing labels anytime.</li>
            <li>Each email can have multiple labels at once.</li>
